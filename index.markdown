> I am actively looking for a PostDoc position starting from March 2026.

I received the Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE) from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2026 under the supervision of Prof. [Shenghui Song](https://eeshsong.home.ece.ust.hk/). Prior to that, I received the B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Tongji University in 2017. My research interests include:

- Federated Learning (FL), especially data heterogeneity, privacy concerns, communication efficiency, and convergence analysis.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially policy optimization and RL theory.
- Trustworthy and Distributed Reinforcement Learning, specifically Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL). Focusing on the Weighted Value Problems (WVPs) and Environment Heterogeneity. I am particularly interested in establishing the theoretical foundation of FRL and delivering algorithms with rigorous mathematical guarantees.

Prior to HKUST, I had been working with Prof. [Yi Xing](https://xinglab.org/people/yi-xing/) on researching and developing high-performance alternative splicing analysis algorithms for large-scale RNA-Seq data.
